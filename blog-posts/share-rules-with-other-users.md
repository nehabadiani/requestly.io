## Create a Shared List

The process of sharing rules is fairly simple and I'll show how to do it in just a few steps:

- Select the rules from the list that you would like to share
  <img alt="select rules" src="/assets/blog-images/requestly-select-rule-to-share.png" />

- Next Click the Share Button on the toolbar which appears after the rules to be shared have been selected.  
  <img alt="Click on Share Button on toolbar" src="/assets/blog-images/click-on-share-btn.png" />

- At this point if you aren't Logged into your account, you will be prompted to Log In.
- If Logged in, then your shared list will be created successfully and this dialog will appear with some pre-defined details </br> like your shared list name and public URL.
  <img alt="Enter a meaningful name for your sharedList and Click on Create Button." src="/assets/blog-images/shared-list-dialog.png" />

- Now if you wish to rename your shared list then you can do so by simply clicking on the edit icon next to your shared list name.</br> Once edited, simply press enter to save the changes and update the URL accordingly.

- From here on you can either copy the link and share with your colleagues and friends (or) you can enter emails </br>separated by a comma (,) and they will be notified from our end.

- You can manage your Shared List from Shared List option on the top nav bar.
