No doubt [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) is an awesome tool which helps you debug your mobile apps easily. But if you are looking for a better alternative to help you modify you network requests, you might want to consider trying Requestly. Here are some reasons why...

## Collaboration

Requestly makes collaboration easier by letting you share your rules with your friends/teammates with the help of [Sharedlist](https://requestly.io/blog/share-rules-with-other-users/). No need to share your configuration files when you can do it in instantly using Sharedlist.

## No System Wide Proxy Required

Charles setup involves setting a system wide proxy on your device. This can sometimes mess up your device's network configurations. The wrong proxy settings might hinder you from even accessing the internet for normal browsing.

Requestly doesn't setup any system wide proxy (unless you want one) and only intercepts the requests of specific browser instances launched by Requestly. Even when you do setup the system-wide proxy from within the [Requestly Desktop App](https://requestly.io/desktop/), you are just one-click away from reverting this change.
Hence, now you can work with a very powerful proxy tool without worrying about if it will mess up your system's network configurations

## Easy to Use

Debugging tools can be complex when using them for the first time. Requestly tries tackle this by making use of Rules. Each rule type helps you achieve common usecases like [modifying headers](https://requestly.io/feature/modify-request-response-headers/) or [redirecting requests](https://requestly.io/feature/redirect-url).

## Regular Updates

Charles sometimes takes 4-6 months until they release their next update.
Requestly has a reputation of listening to user feedback and quickly rolling out new features and updates. If you have a feature request, you can [raise an issue on github](https://github.com/requestly/requestly) and you will probably get a very quick response

## Support

When you are trying to debug something in production, that last thing you want is to wait 2 days for a support team to respond just so you can understand how to use your debugging tool.
Requestly's support team is highly-skilled and available round-the-clock to help you with any problems that you are facing while using requestly.

## Hope this has convinced you enough to [download Requestly](https://requestly.io/downloads/) and try it yourself.
