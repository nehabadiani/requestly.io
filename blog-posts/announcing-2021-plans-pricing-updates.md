# Plans & Pricing Changes

Requestly was started as a hobby project in June 2014 and It has been more than 7 years into existence. Our love for the product has only increased as we interacted with our early stage users, got some great feedback, and improved upon it every day & night. We have added some great tools and capabilities over the last couple of years.

These updates have not only delivered incremental value, they’ve redefined how developers debug the local network traffic - be it APIs, scripts or stylesheets. In this year, we’ve shipped more than 20 features and improvements, including significant ones like --

- <a href="https://requestly.io/blog/2021/07/02/adding-delay-to-network-requests" target="_blank">Simulate delays in the network requests</a>
- <a href="https://requestly.io/blog/2020/06/08/introducing-modify-ajax-response-rule/" target="_blank">Override API Response pragmatically</a>
- [Mock Server](https://requestly.io/feature/mock-server)
- [npm package to run requestly rules in UI automation testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@requestly/selenium)
- [Launching our desktop apps for all platforms](https://requestly.io/desktop)
- and many more..

All this innovation and capability is now available via three developer-focused plans --

- <strong>Requestly Free:</strong> Create upto 3 Modification Rules along with all core basic tooling. Collaboration for upto 3 users.
- <strong>Requestly Basic:</strong> Create upto 10 Modification rules with some premium tooling. Requestly Basic will be available at $12/month per user, billed annually. Collaboration for upto 10 users.
- <strong>Requestly Professional:</strong> Create upto 1000 Modification rules with all premium tooling. Our existing premium plan customers will be migrated to this plan. The new price is $25/month per user, billed annually, effective January 15, 2022.

All of this change will be effective <strong>starting January 15, 2022</strong> So our existing users who'd like to avail the current prices, they can lock-in the current price before the said date. There will be no change in their subscription once started.

Furthermore, I'd love to hear your thoughts & suggestions, you can [submit your feedback here](https://app.requestly.io/feedback). It reaches directly my Inbox.

If you have further questions about the new plans, we are here to help! You can reach us at [sales@requestly.io](mailto:sales@requestly.io)
