If you are a [Requestly](https://www.requestly.in) user, you already know there are 7 different types of rules that you may create to override default behavior of network requests in a webpage. And to achieve some particular use-case, you might have created one or more of these rules.

Great! But over time, as you create more and more rules, the list becomes too large to manage.

_Looking for a way to organize them into logical groups and enable/disable in one go?_

Well! We are really excited to introduce a new feature in Requestly – **Rule Groups**.

It allows you to:

- create new group
- create rule within a group
- move existing rules to a group
- enable/disable group and all its rules in one action
- share/export/import a group of rules
- ungroup existing rules in group
- delete group and its rules
- rename a group

Through this document, you will learn how “Groups” can be used to manage your rules better.
