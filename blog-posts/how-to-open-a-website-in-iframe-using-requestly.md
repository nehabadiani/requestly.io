Often companies add a header to their website so that the browser will refuse to open the page within an i-frame. But using a Chrome extension like Requestly, you can implement a work-around.

The header is called `X-Frame-Options` and you can modify it’s value with Requestly like this:

and that’s it! That is how easy it is with Requestly.

Install the Requestly extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-redirect-url-mo/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en) and try it!
