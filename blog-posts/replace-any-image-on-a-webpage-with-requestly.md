Have you ever wondered how your new logo will look like on the production version of your page? Would you like to see that beautiful new logo in context?

The [Requestly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-redirect-url-mo/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en) extension for Chrome can help you. You can setup a simple rule using the graphical interface of Requestly. Here is an example that replaces the Google logo with Bing logo on Google homepage!

And after configuring this rule you can simply reload the page to see this:
