Have you been using Resource Override to modify request/response headers, redirect URLs, insert scripts, and more?

Then you might want to know this:

Resource Override went into Maintenance Mode a while back.
This means that the extension won&#39;t be offering any new features and will continue to maintain and fix any bugs that pop up in the current version.
And no to mention, in case Chrome or Firefox make changes in their requirements, this extension might stop existing on these platforms.

So what do you do now?

Requestly has got your back! _But what is Requestly?_
Requestly is a lightweight proxy available as a browser extension and desktop app to intercept and modify network requests.

_Okay, why use it instead of Resource Override?_
Apart from the above-mentioned reasons, Requestly does all that override does and more with UI cleaner than ever!
