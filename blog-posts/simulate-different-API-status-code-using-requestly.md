This article will take you through how to use [Requestly](https://requestly.io) to simulate fake 404, 500 response status codes and test your frontend app `without changing anything in your codebase`. There are two possible ways to solve this using Requestly:

- [Requestly Desktop App](/desktop) (1 step)
- [Requestly Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-modify-headers/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa) (2 step)
  <br />
  <br />

> If you want to simulate a different status code for network traffic in Android apps, use our [Android Debugger](/debug-android-apps/)

# Using Desktop App

You can use any MITM proxy to intercept the request and simulate the status code. However, using [Requestly Desktop App](/desktop), it is possible in a single step.

### Steps

- Go to Rules Tab and Click on New Rule
- Select Modify Response
- Define the exact URL (or Pattern) and define the status code. That's it.

Here's a step by step video [demo](https://youtu.be/nLcIZGmMAtQ) explaning same.

Download Requestly Desktop App from [here](/desktop)

# Using Browser Extension

[Requestly Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-modify-headers/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa) can simulate different status codes on an API by redirecting the actual API to a mock API using Requestly's `Redirect Rule`.

## Steps

### 1. Create a mock API using Requestly

Requestly has a Mock Server capability to create a Mock API response. Here are the steps to create one.

- Create a new mock API here- [https://app.requestly.io/mock-server/viewer/create](https://app.requestly.io/mock-server/viewer/create)
- Set the status code you want to simulate (404, 500 ...).

Example mock Simulating 500 status code- [https://app.requestly.io/mock/aIfQd7toGFUMCL0PZDrc](https://app.requestly.io/mock/aIfQd7toGFUMCL0PZDrc)

_Requestly mock server handles the [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers automatically so that the browser does not block the cross-origin requests._

### 2. Redirecting actual API endpoint to the Mock Server endpoint.

- Setup a [redirect rule](https://requestly.io/feature/redirect-url) to redirect the actual API to the requestly mock API.

### 3. Removing Content-Security-Policy Headers

Sometimes redirection to mock API wonâ€™t work due to [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)- [connect-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src) directive, which restricts the URLs loaded using script interfaces.

You can use the [Requestly marketplace](https://app.requestly.io/marketplace) rule to bypass this, which has a prebuilt rule to remove the `content-security-policy` header. Thats it.

I hope this empowers you to do robust testing of your frontend app/website by simulating different API behaviours.
