The User-Agent request header is most commonly used by servers to identify its client’s application type, operating system, software vendor or software version. Based on the User-Agent string, server selects suitable content to be sent in response. For instance, when a website is opened in a mobile device, it usually looks quite compact and different compared to the way it opens in desktop.

Now imagine if your browser allows you to override the User-Agent string, you could see any version of a website you like! All you need to do is to install<span> </span>[Requestly](https://www.requestly.in/)<span> </span>extension in your browser and enjoy the fun.

You can choose among popular devices like `Android Phone`, `iPhone`, tablets or web browsers like `Internet Explorer`, `Safari`, etc. Or you may also specify a `Custom User-Agent` string to experience a specific version of website.

Requestly has a simple rule builder where you specify the source request URL or domain and select type of User Agent. You may also choose whether to override User-Agent only for the website URL or for all HTTP requests originating from that page.
