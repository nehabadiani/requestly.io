    question: <>Can we use Requestly only in debug builds?</>,
    answer: (
      <>
        Our SDK integration is quite flexible and can be set by a feature flag.
        You can integrate Requestly debugger only in debug builds and It will
        never come up in release builds.{" "}

        within a team only?

    question: <>How is Requestly different than Charles?</>,
    answer: (
      <>
        Charles can only be used by an individual developer & requires complex
        setup of proxy & certificates. Requestly SDK can be integrated with just
        3 lines of code and users can collaborate on testing.{" "}

    question: <>Can I mock an API response using Requestly?</>,
    answer: (
      <>
        With Modify Response rule, you`ll now be able to mock the response of an
        API. Similar to other Rules, this Rule will also allow you to specify
        advanced filters including the regular expressions.
